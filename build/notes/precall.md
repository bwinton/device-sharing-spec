#Call Label
Note the _Orange Prickly Badger_ label beneath the URL (and in the customize panel). This is used when you see this incoming call, as a hint to the user that the incoming call is the one you recently shared (or perhaps one labelled from the past).

The assumption here is that users are wary of answering calls (especially video) with no label or from unknown sources.
