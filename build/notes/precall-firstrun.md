#Terms & Notices
Users are required to accept Mozilla/Loop terms and policies before placing their first call. After clicking 'OK', this would not show up again.

The panel is by design the first entry point to Loop. No incoming call can happen without first obtaining a link through the panel.

##Questions
1. Would we store this locally? Or keep track of accepted terms for each account?
