#Call Label
Because a link was sent to a non-contact, the label _Orange Prickly Badger_ is the only way to identify the incoming call. This label was either auto-generated at link generation time, or customized by the user at link generation time.

Again, the idea is to avoid having blank incoming calls which forces the user to accept/decline with no knowledge of the caller.
